The Cape Computer & Technology Club's home is in Cape Town, South Africa and was founded in 1978, right at the beginning of the personal computer revolution
Our activities include meetings once a month at our venue, the N G Kerk Board Room in Ophir Road in Plumstead and a newsletter which is emailed to all members.  Although most personal computing today is done using Windows and Apple, we look at the various versions of Linux and keep abreast of developments.  We sometimes have away meetings at dealers
From May 2020, meetings are held using ZOOM
You will be advised by email of the date and time, the ZOOM meeting ID and current password.  Start ZOOM on your computer with a webcam or tablet, click JOIN, enter the meeting ID and when prompted, enter the current password
You are most welcome to attend one of our meetings and find out what we do.  The annual membership fee is R 150,00 and for that you will be able to join our community and use the facilities provided.  Send us an email and we will add you to our monthly newsletter distribution list free of charge
Table Mountain is one of the seven wonders of the natural world.  Cape Town is at the heart of the Western Cape province of South Africa, renowned for its Mediterranean climate, vast vineyards, spectacular scenery, pristine beaches and friendly people
